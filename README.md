# BOTB-bot
Beedo. ðŸ¤–

## Summary
This is a Discord bot specifically designed for Battle of the Brook (BOTB), which is a tournament that runs every semester with 60-80 players, to automate the process of manually creating each individual team role, text channel, and voice channel, and setting the permissions. All the commands processes the data in bulk, i.e.: there are no commands for handling smaller chunks of data. 

**NOTE:** the mock data this bot was built off was a smaller scale with 2 players for each team. Additionally, the bot expects the Excel sheet to have each player's details in a specific format per column: Player 1 First Name, Player 1 Last Name, Player 1 Email, Player 1 Discord. 

*Please update any variables with "MAGIC" to fit your needs. The data parsing can be updated as well to fit the format of your Excel sheet.*

### Setup
1) Create your Discord bot from the Discord Developer Portal.
2) *Optional: create your own MongoDB database on MongoDB Atlas*
3) Download the Excel sheet of team and player details. Each row indicates a unique team.
4) Set up your .env file with the following: **TOKEN** (OAuth Token), **DB** (MongoDB connection string), **CLIENTID** (Bot Account), **GUILDID** (Discord server)
5) Clone this repository.
6) Use ``npm install`` to install all the necessary packages.

### How to Use
